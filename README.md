# Bio-Hotspots Web
## Introduction
This website has been developed for the 2023 NASA Space Apps Challenge, under the project title **'Exploring Biodiversity Hotspots with Imaging Spectroscopy.'** Our primary objective is to utilize spectral diversity as an indicator of leaf trait variability to uncover biodiversity hotspots among plant species.

The website is divided into four main sections, including an **interactive map**, an **introduction**, an **analysis**, and a **reference** page.
